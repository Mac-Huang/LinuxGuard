xfs: avoid dquot buffer pin deadlock

On shutdown when quotas are enabled, the shutdown can deadlock
trying to unpin the dquot buffer buf_log_item like so:

The CIL push has seen the deadlock, so it has aborted the push and
is running CIL checkpoint completion to abort all the items in the
checkpoint. This calls ->iop_unpin(remove = true) to clean up the
log items in the checkpoint.

When a buffer log item is unpined like this, it needs to lock the
buffer to run io completion to correctly fail the buffer and run all
the required completions to fail attached log items as well. In this
case, the attempt to lock the buffer on unpin is hanging because the
buffer is already locked.

I suspected a leaked XFS_BLI_HOLD state because of XFS_BLI_STALE
handling changes I was testing, so I went looking for
pin events on HOLD buffers and unpin events on locked buffer. That
isolated this one buffer with these two events:

xfs_buf_item_pin:     dev 251:6 daddr 0xa910 bbcount 0x2 hold 2 pincount 0 lock 0 flags DONE|KMEM recur 0 refcount 1 bliflags HOLD|DIRTY|LOGGED liflags DIRTY
....
xfs_buf_item_unpin:   dev 251:6 daddr 0xa910 bbcount 0x2 hold 4 pincount 1 lock 0 flags DONE|KMEM recur 0 refcount 1 bliflags DIRTY liflags ABORTED

Firstly, bbcount = 0x2, which means it is not a single sector
structure. That rules out every xfs_trans_bhold() case except one:
dquot buffers.

Then hung task dumping gave this trace:

Yup, another test run by check-parallel is running drop_caches
concurrently and the dquot shrinker for the hung filesystem is
running. That's trying to flush a dirty dquot from reclaim context,
and it waiting on a log force to complete. xfs_qm_dqflush is called
with the dquot buffer held locked, and so we've called
xfs_log_force() with that buffer locked.

Now the log force is waiting for a workqueue flush to complete, and
that workqueue flush is waiting of CIL checkpoint processing to
finish.

The CIL checkpoint processing is aborting all the log items it has,
and that requires locking aborted buffers to cancel them.

Now, normally this isn't a problem if we are issuing a log force
to unpin an object, because the ->iop_unpin() method wakes pin
waiters first. That results in the pin waiter finishing off whatever
it was doing, dropping the lock and then xfs_buf_item_unpin() can
lock the buffer and fail it.

However, xfs_qm_dqflush() is waiting on the -dquot- unpin event, not
the dquot buffer unpin event, and so it never gets woken and so does
not drop the buffer lock.

Inodes do not have this problem, as they can only be written from
one spot (->iop_push) whilst dquots can be written from multiple
places (memory reclaim, ->iop_push, xfs_dq_dqpurge, and quotacheck).

The reason that the dquot buffer has an attached buffer log item is
that it has been recently allocated. Initialisation of the dquot
buffer logs the buffer directly, thereby pinning it in memory. We
then modify the dquot in a separate operation, and have memory
reclaim racing with a shutdown and we trigger this deadlock.

check-parallel reproduces this reliably on 1kB FSB filesystems with
quota enabled because it does all of these things concurrently
without having to explicitly write tests to exercise these corner
case conditions.

xfs_qm_dquot_logitem_push() doesn't have this deadlock because it
checks if the dquot is pinned before locking the dquot buffer and
skipping it if it is pinned. This means the xfs_qm_dqunpin_wait()
log force in xfs_qm_dqflush() never triggers and we unlock the
buffer safely allowing a concurrent shutdown to fail the buffer
appropriately.

xfs_qm_dqpurge() could have this problem as it is called from
quotacheck and we might have allocated dquot buffers when recording
the quota updates. This can be fixed by calling
xfs_qm_dqunpin_wait() before we lock the dquot buffer. Because we
hold the dquot locked, nothing will be able to add to the pin count
between the unpin_wait and the dqflush callout, so this now makes
xfs_qm_dqpurge() safe against this race.

xfs_qm_dquot_isolate() can also be fixed this same way but, quite
frankly, we shouldn't be doing IO in memory reclaim context. If the
dquot is pinned or dirty, simply rotate it and let memory reclaim
come back to it later, same as we do for inodes.

This then gets rid of the nasty issue in xfs_qm_flush_one() where
quotacheck writeback races with memory reclaim flushing the dquots.
We can lift xfs_qm_dqunpin_wait() up into this code, then get rid of
the "can't get the dqflush lock" buffer write to cycle the dqlfush
lock and enable it to be flushed again.  checking if the dquot is
pinned and returning -EAGAIN so that the dquot walk will revisit the
dquot again later.

Finally, with xfs_qm_dqunpin_wait() lifted into all the callers,
we can remove it from the xfs_qm_dqflush() code.

I've seen the AGI variant from scrub running on the filesysetm
after unmount failed due to systemd interference:

 XFS: Assertion failed: pag->pagi_freecount == be32_to_cpu(agi->agi_freecount) || xfs_is_shutdown(pag->pag_mount), file: fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_ialloc.c, line: 2804

Essentially, it is the same problem. When _flakey_drop_and_remount()
loads the drop-writes table, it makes all writes silently fail. Writes
are reported to the fs as completed successfully, but they are not
issued to the backing store. The filesystem sees the successful
write completion and marks the metadata buffer clean and removes it
from the AIL.

If this happens at the same time as memory pressure is occuring,
the now-clean AGF and/or AGI buffers can be reclaimed from memory.

Shortly afterwards, but before _flakey_drop_and_remount() runs
unmount, background writeback is kicked and it tries to allocate
blocks for the dirty pages in memory. This then tries to access the
AGF buffer we just turfed out of memory. It's not found, so it gets
read in from disk.

This is all fine, except for the fact that the last writeback of the
AGF did not actually reach disk. The AGF on disk is stale compared
to the in-memory state held by the perag, and so they don't match
and the assert fires.

Then other operations on that inode hang because the task was killed
whilst holding inode locks. e.g:

 Workqueue: xfs-conv/dm-12 xfs_end_io

and it's all down hill from there.

Memory pressure is one way to trigger this, another is to run "echo
3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" randomly while tests are running.

Regardless of how it is triggered, this effectively takes down the
system once umount hangs because it's holding a sb->s_umount lock
exclusive and now every sync(1) call gets stuck on it.

Fix this by replacing the asserts with a corruption detection check
and a shutdown.

## Commit 5: 09234a63

**Author:** Dave Chinner
**Date:** 2025-06-27 14:08:39
**Files Changed:** fs/xfs/xfs_icache.c, fs/xfs/xfs_inode.c

**Message:**
```
xfs: xfs_ifree_cluster vs xfs_iflush_shutdown_abort deadlock

Lock order of xfs_ifree_cluster() is cluster buffer -> try ILOCK
-> IFLUSHING, except for the last inode in the cluster that is
triggering the free. In that case, the lock order is ILOCK ->
cluster buffer -> IFLUSHING.

xfs_iflush_cluster() uses cluster buffer -> try ILOCK -> IFLUSHING,
so this can safely run concurrently with xfs_ifree_cluster().

xfs_inode_item_precommit() uses ILOCK -> cluster buffer, but this
cannot race with xfs_ifree_cluster() so being in a different order
will not trigger a deadlock.

xfs_reclaim_inode() during a filesystem shutdown uses ILOCK ->
IFLUSHING -> cluster buffer via xfs_iflush_shutdown_abort(), and
this deadlocks against xfs_ifree_cluster() like so:

We can't change the lock order of xfs_ifree_cluster() - XFS_ISTALE
and XFS_IFLUSHING are serialised through to journal IO completion
by the cluster buffer lock being held.

There's quite a few asserts in the code that check that XFS_ISTALE
does not occur out of sync with buffer locking (e.g. in
xfs_iflush_cluster). There's also a dependency on the inode log item
being removed from the buffer before XFS_IFLUSHING is cleared, also
with asserts that trigger on this.

Further, we don't have a requirement for the inode to be locked when
completing or aborting inode flushing because all the inode state
updates are serialised by holding the cluster buffer lock across the
IO to completion.

We can't check for XFS_IRECLAIM in xfs_ifree_mark_inode_stale() and
skip the inode, because there is no guarantee that the inode will be
reclaimed. Hence it *must* be marked XFS_ISTALE regardless of
whether reclaim is preparing to free that inode. Similarly, we can't
check for IFLUSHING before locking the inode because that would
result in dirty inodes not being marked with ISTALE in the event of
racing with XFS_IRECLAIM.

Hence we have to address this issue from the xfs_reclaim_inode()
side. It is clear that we cannot hold the inode locked here when
calling xfs_iflush_shutdown_abort() because it is the inode->buffer
lock order that causes the deadlock against xfs_ifree_cluster().

Hence we need to drop the ILOCK before aborting the inode in the
shutdown case. Once we've aborted the inode, we can grab the ILOCK
again and then immediately reclaim it as it is now guaranteed to be
clean.

Note that dropping the ILOCK in xfs_reclaim_inode() means that it
can now be locked by xfs_ifree_mark_inode_stale() and seen whilst in
this state. This is safe because we have left the XFS_IFLUSHING flag
on the inode and so xfs_ifree_mark_inode_stale() will simply set
XFS_ISTALE and move to the next inode. An ASSERT check in this path
needs to be tweaked to take into account this new shutdown
interaction.
